      <h1>Protecting your information</h1>
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <p>
          We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from
          loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The REST’s online donation site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
          and alteration of information under our control. We have implemented measures designed to
          secure the collection and transmission of sensitive user information, including credit
          card information, by using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology. This method
          reflects industry standard security protocol and makes it difficult for anyone to
          intercept your credit card information. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data
          security measures can guarantee security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Credit card numbers are not stored on any REST servers. In REST’s software application,
          credit card numbers are replaced with reference tokens that are used to process future
          transactions (e.g. for recurring gift pledges). REST’s staff cannot access your credit
          card information at any time.

      <h1>How we use "cookies"</h1>
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically
          collected by the REST’s website through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files
          that a website can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate visitors’ ongoing access
          to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate
          data that will facilitate content improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor’s system and damage files. Generally,
          cookies work by assigning to the visitor a unique number that has no meaning outside the
          assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of
          cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or
          accept the cookie feature. For more information about how to disable cookies, refer to the
          “help” or “customer support” section of your specific browser application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use clear GIFs, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
          function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your device, clear GIFs
          are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs
          or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities
          of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage. We
          and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us
          track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our
          emails are forwarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          REST uses cookie and other online tracking technology to improve visitors’ online
          experience and facilitate their visit within our site, to better understand how visitors
          use our website, and to assist us with our online marketing efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of
          our Site. We use these tools to help us improve the performance of our Site and our user’s
          experience on our Site. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies,
          such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To learn
          more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at
          https://www.google.com/policies/privacy. You can also download the Google Analytics
          Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics at
          https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use network advertisers to serve online advertisements on non-affiliated websites or
          other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these network
          advertisers to target advertisements to you for products, services, and organizations in
          which you might be interested. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic
          measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs),
          Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and
          to personalize advertising content to you. These cookies and other technologies are
          governed by each entity's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these
          advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
        </p>

        <p>
          As noted above, we disclose certain information (such as your email address) to Facebook
          Custom Audiences (for more information on Facebook Custom Audience go here or to opt-out,
          go to the Facebook ad preferences page) and Google (to opt-out of Google Analytics
          Audiences and other Google advertising, go here)—so that we can better target ads and
          content to you and others with similar interests on third parties’ websites or media
          (“Custom Audiences”). We may also work with other ad networks and marketing platforms that
          enable us and other participants to target ads to Custom Audiences submitted by us and
          others. You may also control how Facebook and other third parties display certain ads to
          you, as explained further in their respective privacy policies or by using the opt-outs
          described below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users may opt out of many ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising
          Alliance ("DAA") Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based
          advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may
          also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Consumer Opt-Out Page for
          information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding
          having information used by NAI members.
        </p>

        <p>
          Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI
          Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based
          content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising
          through our Site, Services, or on other websites. You may continue to receive
          advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e.,
          contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you
          opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out may not be effective. Additional
          information is available on the DAA's website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI's website at
          www.networkadvertising.org.

      <h1>International Personal Information</h1>
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) is a European Union regulation concerning
          the use and processing of personal information of individuals located in the European
          Union. GDPR is effective as of May 25, 2018. We are committed to processing your
          information in compliance with the GDPR, as applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use reasonable efforts to securely process all personal information in line with
          the rights specified under the GDPR, in particular those related to the following
          requests:
        </p>
        <p>Access to your personal information;</p>
        <p>Correction of the personal information that we hold;</p>
        <p>Deletion of your personal information;</p>
        <p>A restriction of processing of your personal information;</p>
        <p>Transfer of your personal information to another party; or</p>
        <p>
          Objection to processing of your personal information based on the REST’s legitimate
          interest (or those of a third party) to use it and there is something about your
          particular situation that causes you to object to such processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will hold your information and use it as described in this Privacy Policy. We consider
          that the REST has a legitimate interest in collecting and processing your information. The
          REST responds to the world’s worst humanitarian crises and helps people whose lives and
          livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster to survive, recover, and gain control
          of their future and pursuing these aims is not in conflict with your rights. This provides
          our lawful basis to use your personal information, within the limitations set forth
          herein.
